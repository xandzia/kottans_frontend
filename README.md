## Task_4
#### Something new:
- [device pixel ratio](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8785643/what-exactly-is-device-pixel-ratio) (logical pixels
(Device Independent Pixels. example:'1600px') + physical pixels(Hardware Pixels. ex:'800px') = device pixel ratio '2'), device-aspect-ratio.
- simulators, emulators (mobile debugging using the development tools on a desktop machine)
- CSS: resolution, orientation
- font boosting
#### Surprised:
- the instructor of the course has a good low voice timbre. it was nice listening
#### Thing you intend to use in the future:
- Try not to use !important

## Task_5
- I always were confusing which logical operation gives true ( && or || ) when one of the argument is false. Now I cleary know it :)
- Notes: 
```
condition ? ( do this if TRUE ) : ( do that if FALSE);

for ( start; stop; step ) {
  // do this thing
}

```
-It was hard but fantastic, especially when I stuck at task "triangle". but after 2 hour it shown me really happiness. The next tasks were easily. It is one of the best course.
