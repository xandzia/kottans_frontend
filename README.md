## Task_5
### [Intro to JS](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-javascript--ud803)

```
condition ? ( do this if TRUE ) : ( do that if FALSE);

for ( start; stop; step ) {
  // do this thing
}

```
-It was hard but fantastic, especially when I stuck at task "triangle". but after 2 hour it shown me really happiness. The next tasks were easily. It is one of the best course.

## Task_7
### [Offline Web Applications](https://www.udacity.com/course/offline-web-applications--ud899)
