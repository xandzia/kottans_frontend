Basic​ ​remote​ ​control
In our product we would have to remote control the robot.
Create a basic client server system for remote controlling the robot with a virtual joystick.
Server
Django application with one model - direction.
The server will also have a post rest API.
Client
React.js based web app with nipple.js (https://github.com/yoannmoinet/nipplejs).
The application will send every 100 ms post to the server with the direction of the nipple.

Please send a link to a repository with the relevant code.
Test task should take not more than 4-5 hours
